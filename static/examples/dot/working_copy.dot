#//////////////////////////////// Introduction \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
/*
    This graph is meant as a starting point to help you create UML Class
    Diagrams by providing a preset for edges and nodes.

    To use it, you need to take the folowing steps:

     - Copy and paste (or "save as") this graph into a new file
     - Rename the relevant labels (anything with the word "Example" in it).
     - Add nodes (inside subgraphs when needed)
     - Add connections for the nodes

    Make sure you place your connections under the right headers, otherwise the
    decoration won't match the UML specifications.

    For each module you should use a separate subgraph. Make sure the name of
    your subgraph starts with `cluster_`

    If you don't like the colors, the easiest way to ammend this is by changing
    the defined colorscheme (currently "pastel13") in the "General Styles"
    section to any other 3-scheme. All available colorschemes can be found at
    http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/colors.html#brewer
