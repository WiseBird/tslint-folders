## 'nice to have' TODOs

- [ ] ?add vs code debug config

- ~~rename package to module ? is clearer? but not really correct, usually is 1 file. up minor.~~

- ~~? add Jpg format (new npm? from new src folder)~~ use graphviz!

- [ ] ? add examples folder with a site that has issues

---

## notes

config:

- [x] config from tslint-folders.json that's imported by tslint.json
- [ ] throw if config has circ reference

- [x] 'separable package' - import no recognised packages : no special case needed (simply no children)

---

- model internal folders:

components
viewmodels
models
services
utils

-- PackageSubFolder : PackageFolder

- container: Package (no hierarchy of sub folders)

- can import any PackageNode children of container

- if importing a recognised PackageSubFolder (from container.allowedFolders)

then only allow if in this.allowedFolders

---

### model dumping

[x] - `yarn docs` outputs a text graph

dump to simple text format

so don't need dot to ascii

format:

```
packageName1 --> packageName2, packageName3
  folder1 --> folder2, folder3
  folder2 --> folder3
  folder3
```

- ~~md format?~~

* [x] dot as alt format could also be useful

* ~~jpg format (internally dot -> jpg) in separate project tslint-folders-diagrams to control npm size~~

```
yarn docs tslint.json Dot
```

---

### TODO disallow import [relative, src] from recognised package

extend the main rule, using the config:

- [ ] import from recognised package should not be relative (like /myPackage/)
- [ ] import from recognised package should not include /src/
      by adding a ban prop into PackageFolder:

      ```
      "ban": ["{PACKAGE}/src/", "/{PACKAGE}/"]
      ```

---

### TODO make the 'test' rules be configurable

- make configurable, without breaking config (cover via test sub-folders named by version)

- [ ] make rule customisable: tsf-folders-test-with-breakpoint
      by adding an includePaths: string[] prop and a debugTokens: ["browser.debug"]

- [ ] make rule customisable: tsf-folders-disabled-tests
      by adding an includePaths: string[] prop and a ban: ["it.only", "it.skip","describe.only","describe.skip"]

---

### TODO ts versions

- support typescript 3 

- from diff branch? and npm pub to 1.x. note in readme about older version for ts 2.9

- ts version history:

https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/commits/master/package.json

- version to match ts ? else confusing. but need minor to make a breaking change!
```
-- tsf 2.9m.p = ts 2.9 
-- tsf 3.0m.p = ts 3.0
-- tsf 3.1m.p = ts 3.1
-- tsf 3.2m.p = ts 3.2
where m = minor, p = patch
```
- branch like versions/tsf2.9
- pub to npm as normal, with correct peer deps
- dev on feature/x -> master
- also merge into a version branch, as needed
- do NOT dev on version branch
- doc in readme
- how does tslint manage it?
- is tslint format more important? But less so for user
---

### todo c4
- [ ] add support for alt format C4

https://c4model.com/#notation

context, container, component, (code)
